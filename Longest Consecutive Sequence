Longest Consecutive Sequence:
Longest Consecutive Sequences:
Brute Force Approach:
In this approach we will simply use linear search.
We will run loop and iterate through each element one by one.
For every element x we will try to find x+1,x+2,x+3 so we will use the linear search.
We will take count variable initialized with 1, and a take a longest  variable initialized by 1. if next element found we will increase the count value. and find the max of longest and count.

Better approach:
In this approach first we will sort the array. Here also we will use 2 variable count and longest. longest initialized with INT_MIN and count initialized with 1.
We will run a loop for iterate through each element one by one.
For each element we will check this element is the part of our sequence or not.
We will check arr[i+1]==arr[i]+1 , if equal we will the count value. and put the max value of longest and count into the longest.
else if arr[i+1]>=arr[i]+1 , we will will set the count 1.
return the longest value.
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.empty()) return 0;
        if(nums.size()==1) return 1;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int n=nums.size();
        int ans_max=INT_MIN;
        int ans=1;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            if(nums[i+1]==nums[i]+1){
                ans++;
            }
            else if(nums[i+1]>=nums[i]+1){
                ans=1;
            }
            ans_max=max(ans_max,ans);
        }
        return ans_max;
    }
};
