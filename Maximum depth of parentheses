Maximum depth of parentheses
For finding maximum depth of parentheses we check the opening brackets.
ex:
Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
we take 2 variable first for result and second for count the current char is opening "(" bracket or not.
Initialized
res=0 , count=0
1: first we check every char of string s if it is open bracket   '('  increase the count and update the result with maximum count
res=max(res,count)
2: If the current character is closing bracket ')' then we decrease the count .
and return the result
