Reverse Words in a string:
First We remove all whitespace of the given string in python there is split() function in str for removing all whitespaces.
Then we take 2 pointer start and end start is initialized with index of first character of the string and end is initialized with last character of the given string.
we traverse a loop until start < end.
Then we swap start and end.
increase the start pointer and decrease the end pointer.
after that we join the reverse string by a space
return it.
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
       words=s.split()
       start=0
       end=len(words)-1
       while start<end:
        words[start],words[end]=words[end],words[start]
        start+=1
        end-=1

       return " ".join(words)
