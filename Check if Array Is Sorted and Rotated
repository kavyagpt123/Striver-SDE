Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
For checking array is sorted and rotated or not .We take a variable count and initialized it by 0.
We traverse the array from i=1 and check the condition ,current element of the array is less its previous element or not .If this condition is true then we increase the count value by one.
After traversing the array we check the condition ,last element of the array is greater than first element of the array or not . If it is true then we increase the count value . 
If count value is less than or equal to 1 or not . if it is true than return true.
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].

class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int count =0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(nums[i-1]>nums[i]){
                count++;
            }
        }
            if(nums[n-1]>nums[0]){
                count++;
            }
        return count<=1;
    }
};
