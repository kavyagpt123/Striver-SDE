Print subarray with maximum subarray sum (extended version of above problem)
Max Score from Subarray Mins:
Finding the maximum score from the giving subarray. Maximum Score means our goal to find the subarray  of elements whose sum of first smallest and second smallest is greater. 
We take two variable sum and maxsum sum is initialized to 0 and maxsum is pointing to the first element of the array.
we traverse the array from 0 to size of array -1.
we find the sum of current and current next element . and  update the sum . 
Then we check the condition if sum is greater than the maxsum then we update the maxsum with sum.
Continue this process until all the element of the array is completed.

C++ Solution:
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find pair with maximum sum
    int pairWithMaxSum(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Your code goes here
       int n=arr.size();
       int sum = 0;
       int maxi=arr[0];
       for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
           sum=arr[i]+arr[i+1];
           if(sum>maxi)
           maxi=sum;
       }
        return maxi;
    }
};

Python Solution:
class Solution:
    def pairWithMaxSum(self, arr):
        # Your code goes here
        sum=0
        maxi=arr[0]
        for i in range(0,len(arr)-1):
            sum=arr[i]+arr[i+1]
            if(sum>maxi):
                maxi=sum
        return maxi
